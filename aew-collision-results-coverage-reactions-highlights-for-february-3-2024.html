AEW Collision will go down tonight, and&nbsp;Ringside News&nbsp;has got you covered with live play-by-play results coverage for the February 3, 2024 episode.</p><p>The start time for AEW Collision is 8:00 PM EST. Match-by-match highlights and results from the show will take place on this very page. Feel free to leave any reactions in the comment section below.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aew-collision-lineup-2-3-2024>AEW Collision Lineup (2/3/2024):</h2><ul><li>Red Velvet in action</li><li>Eddie Kingston vs. Bryan Keith</li><li>Bryan Danielson vs. Hechicero</li><li>Christian Cage & Patriarchy (Nick Wayne & Killswitch) vs. FTR (Dax Harwood & Cash Wheeler) & Daniel Garcia</li><li>Serena Deeb vs. Queen Aminata</li><li>We’ll hear from Mark Briscoe</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aew-collision-results-2-3-2024>AEW Collision Results (2/3/2024):</h2><p>The Collision’s opening sequence played out, followed by a burst of pyrotechnics on the stage. Tony Schiavone, Kevin Kelly, and Nigel McGuinness provided commentary, while Dasha Gonzalez handled ring announcing duties. The entrances for the opening match soon followed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-eddie-kingston-vs-bryan-keith-in-a-continental-crown-proving-grounds-match>Eddie Kingston vs. Bryan Keith in a Continental Crown Proving Grounds match</h2><p>The crowd began with enthusiastic “Let’s go Eddie” chants, met with occasional “Bryan Keith” chants in response. The action spilled out to ringside, where Keith slammed Kingston into the barricade. Back inside the ring, Kingston executed a suplex on Keith just before the first picture-in-picture break. [C]<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure></p><p>Kingston suddenly executed the Exploder suplex, but Keith retaliated with a devastating one of his own. He expertly blocked Kingston’s spinning backfist and connected with a powerful Liger Bomb, almost securing the victory. However, Eddie Kingston summoned his resilience and landed the spinning backfist on the second attempt, though Keith still had some fight left in him.</p><p>Eddie unleashed a barrage of machinegun chops in the corner before catching Keith in a sleeper hold and following up with a DDT, coming close to a pinfall. Keith, showing his determination, slapped Eddie repeatedly, but Kingston absorbed the blows and responded with the decisive spinning backfist, pinning Keith for the win.</p><p><strong>Winner: Eddie Kingston</strong></p><p>Tony Schiavone entered the ring to interview Kingston, but Eddie directed him to speak with Keith instead. To everyone’s surprise, Schiavone announced that Bryan Keith was now part of the All Elite roster, with the graphic confirming the news on the video board. Just then, Bryan Danielson made a sudden entrance and raised Keith’s hand, setting the stage for Bryan’s own match, which was up next.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The broadcast then cut to a post-Dynamite promo featuring Jon Moxley, who didn’t hold back in his scathing remarks about the four CMLL individuals who ambushed him during the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryan-danielson-vs-hechicero>Bryan Danielson vs. Hechicero</h2><p>Nigel McGuinness praised Hechicero as the finest technical wrestler to emerge from Mexico in the last three decades. Meanwhile, Tony Schiavone went through the lineup for the upcoming Dynamite episode.</p><p>Hechicero managed to trap Daniel Bryan in a tight rear naked chokehold, putting the pressure on. Danielson fought his way to the ropes and subsequently rolled out of the ring as the show went into a Picture-in-Picture break. [C]</p><p>Hechicero found an opening to break free and swiftly transitioned into his own submission attempt. Bryan fought back, but Hechicero caught him with a punishing backbreaker. However, Danielson managed to regain his composure and attempted his signature running knee strike, only to narrowly miss. Seizing the opportunity, Hechicero ensnared Bryan’s head with his right leg, looking for another submission.</p><p>Bryan, displaying his resilience, rolled over and managed to pin Hechicero down to the mat, securing a hard-fought victory.</p><p>After the match, Hechicero launched a post-match assault on Bryan, but Claudio Castagnoli rushed to the ring to make the save. Hechicero wisely retreated.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In the backstage interview, FTR and Daniel Garcia discussed their future as a trios team. Garcia expressed his contentment at having FTR as his partners, forming a united front for the challenges ahead.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hook-vs-the-outrunners>Hook vs. The Outrunners</h2><p>HOOK triumphed over The Outrunners in a handicap match. However, the ring announcer struggled with The Outrunners’ names, botching their introductions. The commentators revealed that this match was entirely impromptu, as HOOK had requested to face two opponents upon his arrival at the venue.</p><p>The Outrunners initially gained the upper hand and gloated in the ring, posing for the audience. But HOOK quickly rose to his feet and fixated a cold, unwavering gaze on them as they struck their poses. Without hesitation, HOOK isolated his opponents and unleashed a series of brutal crossface blows. He then applied his deadly submission hold, the redrum, locking it in with ruthless precision, bringing the match to an abrupt and decisive end.</p><p>Tony Schiavone stepped into the ring, extending a warm welcome to Mark Briscoe for an interview. Briscoe, showing his respect for Schiavone, took the microphone and discussed his recent involvement in coming to the aid of FTR and Daniel Garcia during last week’s cage match.</p><p>As Briscoe shared his thoughts, the arena’s lights suddenly went out, and the video board illuminated with the presence of the House of Black. Malakai Black expressed his fondness for magic tricks, particularly those that make individuals vanish, alluding to their intentions for Briscoe. The lights then went dark once more, leaving Briscoe on high alert.</p><p>When the lights returned, Malakai continued to taunt Briscoe, asserting their plan to erase him from the world of professional wrestling and insisting that they were already infiltrating his psyche.</p><p>Following this eerie encounter, a video package aired, building anticipation for The Cope Open and Adam Copeland’s pursuit of the TNT Championship. The promise was made to hear from Copeland in the coming week.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-serena-deeb-vs-queen-aminata>Serena Deeb vs. Queen Aminata</h2><p>Aminata cleverly utilized her leg strength to seize the upper hand in the match. She demonstrated her prowess by executing a snap suplex just as the action headed into a commercial break.</p><p>However, upon the return from the break, Deeb rallied and leveled Queen with a punishing lariat. Deeb followed up with a rolling forearm and a swinging neckbreaker, coming close to a pinfall. Aminata managed to slip out of a backslide attempt, retaliating with a forceful headbutt.</p><p>Despite her efforts, Aminata missed a running boot in the corner, which gave Deeb the opening to apply the figure four leglock on Aminata, using the ring post for added leverage. Deeb then maneuvered Aminata back to the center of the ring and locked in the Serenity Lock submission hold, ultimately securing the victory by forcing her opponent to tap out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><br>Tony Schiavone stood in the ring and welcomed Swerve Strickland, highlighting him as the number one contender for the AEW World Title. Tony asked for Swerve’s thoughts on his upcoming match against Hangman Page on Dynamite for the world title shot at Revolution.</p><p>Swerve began by acknowledging Black History Month and expressing gratitude for those who paved the way for him to step into the wrestling ring, mentioning inspirational figures like Kofi Kingston and Athena. He confidently stated that his name would soon join that prestigious list when he defeats Hangman on Dynamite and goes on to capture the world title. Swerve made it clear that he harbored no regrets for the controversial actions he’d taken to secure his current position, emphasizing that he had already beaten Hangman twice, and the third time would be the charm. He was determined to put Hangman behind him and make history as a black champion.</p><p>Interrupting Prince Nana’s attempt to speak, Swerve asserted that the Mogul Embassy wouldn’t be present ringside for the match, emphasizing that there would be no interference and no excuses.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In a separate segment, “Timeless” Toni Storm delivered a promo directed at Deonna Purrazzo, expressing her readiness for a public workout, setting the stage for their upcoming confrontation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-red-velvet-vs-vertvixen>Red Velvet vs. Vertvixen</h2><p>In a lightning-fast match, Red Velvet seized control with a backstabber, swiftly followed by her signature “Stir It Up” spin kick, securing a rapid and decisive victory. With this win under her belt, Red Velvet is now set for a title eliminator match on next week’s edition of Dynamite, where she will face off against Toni Storm.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-daniel-garcia-and-ftr-dax-harwood-and-cash-wheeler-vs-the-patriarchy-christian-cage-killswitch-and-nick-wayne-w-shayna-wayne><strong>Daniel Garcia and “FTR” Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler vs. “The Patriarchy” Christian Cage, Killswitch, and Nick Wayne (w/Shayna Wayne)</strong></h2><p>Christian Cage, accompanied by Killswitch and the Wayne siblings, made their dramatic entrance to the arena, setting the stage for an exciting bout. As the anticipation built, Daniel Garcia added his unique flair with a dance on the stage before the arrival of FTR, who made their way to the ring, ready for action.</p><p>FTR and Daniel Garcia emerged victorious against Christian Cage, Killswitch, and Nick Wayne. As the match progressed, Garcia received a hot tag late in the contest, taking the fight to Nick Wayne with an impressive brainbuster, nearly securing the win. However, Wayne fought back, resorting to a fisherman’s suplex and mocking Garcia’s dance moves, even slapping him in the face.</p><p>Garcia, undeterred, surprised Wayne with a quick roll-up for a near fall. Christian Cage intervened by shoving Garcia off the top rope, leading to Wayne’s World for another close two-count. Chaos ensued in the ring, with all participants getting involved. Killswitch executed a chokeslam on Wheeler, while Dax found himself trapped in Christian’s sharpshooter. Eventually, Dax fell victim to Wayne’s World, allowing Garcia to roll up Nick Wayne for the decisive pinfall victory.</p><p>Following the match, Garcia shared a tense stare-down with TNT Champion Christian Cage, as the commentators speculated about Garcia potentially climbing the rankings for a shot at the TNT title.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>And with that, the show came to an exciting conclusion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX91e49rZmlrX5ayuHnCqKOloaOevK950Z6qrqSkqHqku9WeqZqflWK%2Fpq3CraCopqNitaqzx6WgoKCkqHqnu9FmnZ6aoqqus8WMbGRraGJpfA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2faew-collision-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-february-3-2024.html&text=AEW%20Collision%20Results%20Coverage%2c%20Reactions%20%26amp%3b%20Highlights%20for%20February%203%2c%202024&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faew-collision-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-february-3-2024.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2faew-collision-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-february-3-2024.html&title=AEW%20Collision%20Results%20Coverage%2c%20Reactions%20%26amp%3b%20Highlights%20for%20February%203%2c%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2faew-collision-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-february-3-2024.html&title=AEW%20Collision%20Results%20Coverage%2c%20Reactions%20%26amp%3b%20Highlights%20for%20February%203%2c%202024" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2faew-collision-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-february-3-2024.html&title=AEW%20Collision%20Results%20Coverage%2c%20Reactions%20%26amp%3b%20Highlights%20for%20February%203%2c%202024" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faew-collision-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-february-3-2024.html&description=AEW%20Collision%20Results%20Coverage%2c%20Reactions%20%26amp%3b%20Highlights%20for%20February%203%2c%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fyodor-bondarchuk.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fyodor Bondarchuk movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-love-experiment-cast-30-year-old-tamara-wikipedia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Love Experiment Cast | 30 Year Old Tamara Wikipedia">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
