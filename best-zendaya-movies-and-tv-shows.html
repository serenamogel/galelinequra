At only 27, the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dune</a>&nbsp;star has already been honored with numerous awards, including two Primetime Emmys and a Golden Globe. By 2022, she had made TIME‘s annual list of the 100 most influential individuals in the world. Zendaya made her acting debut at the California Shakespeare Theater as a young girl. Her breakthrough role was as teen dancer Rocky Blue in the Disney Channel’s&nbsp;Shake It Up, which she followed by starring in another hit Disney Channel series,&nbsp;K.C. Undercover.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=614 data-current-count=614 data-injectable=true>Zendaya made her big screen debut in 2017’s&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;and has since reprised her role in both sequels. She also made the leap to more mature roles, such as Rue Bennett in HBO’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Euphoria</a>, for which she received&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series</a>, making her the youngest recipient of the award in its history. Moreover, Zendaya’s fame stems from more than just her acting abilities;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the actress also has a unique sense of style</a>. She’s a regular at fashion shows and red carpets, where her signature style has earned her much acclaim.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>As of 2023, Zendaya has amassed millions of fans on social media who are anticipating the release of her upcoming films like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Challengers, a romantic sports comedy-drama</a>&nbsp;film directed by Luca Guadagnino and set for release in the United States on September 15, 2023. While the wait continues, here are 10 of Zendaya’s most memorable performances from her film and TV credits to date.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-10-k-c-undercover-2015-2018 data-injectable=false>10. K.C. Undercover&nbsp;(2015 – 2018)</h2><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>Zendaya portrayed high school student K.C. Cooper, a secret agent, on the Disney Channel original series&nbsp;K.C. Undercover, which ran from 2015 to 2018. As the daughter of two spies, she carries on the family tradition. K.C. has a knack for numbers, is highly perceptive and quick on her feet, and is quite intellectual, all of which serve her well in her covert work. K.C. may be in a solemn profession, but her offbeat sense of humor makes her fun.</p><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>K.C.’s ability to keep her seemingly everyday high school life and the dangerous realm of international espionage apart is a notable aspect of her personality. While saving the world on covert missions, she still has to deal with the usual challenges of being a teenager: school, family, and friends. As the story progresses, K.C. matures as a person and spy, learning to balance her conflicting roles.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-9-space-jam-a-new-legacy-2021 data-injectable=false>9.&nbsp;Space Jam: A New Legacy&nbsp;(2021)</h2><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>Zendaya voices Lola Bunny in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Space Jam: A New Legacy</a>, the sequel to the classic 1996 film&nbsp;Space Jam, providing her with an opportunity to demonstrate her range outside her live-action performances. Lola Bunny is a feisty and skilled basketball player who has earned a reputation for dominating the floor. The movie introduces her as a fierce, self-reliant rabbit who belongs to the Amazons from the Wonder Woman realm.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>Lola is a vital part of the Tune Squad, the team that LeBron James puts together to assist him in winning a crucial basketball game. The film’s Lola Bunny is a radical shift from the 1996 film’s representation of the character. This upgrade accompanies the film’s overall effort to bring its characters into the present day. Lola is more than just Bugs Bunny’s girlfriend; she’s a fully realized character in her own right with her own goals, abilities, and personality.</p><h2 id=h-8-shake-it-up-2010-2013 data-injectable=false>8.&nbsp;Shake It Up&nbsp;(2010 – 2013)</h2><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>Shake It Up&nbsp;was the first step on Zendaya’s journey to stardom. Zendaya plays one of the show’s main characters, Raquel “Rocky” Blue, alongside Bella Thorne’s CeCe Jones. A brilliant and driven dancer, Rocky Blue and her closest friend CeCe get a job dancing on a Chicago television show called “Shake It Up, Chicago.” Of the two pals, Rocky is the more mature and level-headed one. While she tends to be overly cautious, she is nonetheless compassionate and dependable.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=566 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>While CeCe is more of a free spirit and adventurer, Rocky is the voice of reason, providing a more conservative counterweight to CeCe’s bold schemes. Rocky and CeCe’s relationship, which emphasizes the value of friendship and teamwork despite their differences, is the show’s driving force. Zendaya’s performance as Rocky Blue in “Shake It Up” won rave reviews from both audiences and critics. Zendaya’s career took off thanks primarily to this role, paving the way for her to become an actor, singer, and fashion sensation.</p><h2 id=h-7-malcolm-marie-2021 data-injectable=false>7. Malcolm & Marie&nbsp;(2021)</h2><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>Sam Levinson penned, co-produced, and directed the 2021 American black-and-white romantic drama film&nbsp;Malcolm & Marie,&nbsp;with Zendaya and John David Washington starring and producing. Marie, portrayed by Zendaya, is one half of a feuding pair. Marie has a troubled history and struggles with addiction. She also feels marginalized by her lover, the blossoming filmmaker Malcolm.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=685 data-current-count=1080 data-injectable=true>The movie’s events occur in one night, right after Malcolm’s film premiere (during which he forgets to acknowledge Marie’s involvement during his acceptance speech). Tensions mount as the pair goes on an emotionally raw trip that exposes their relationship’s realities, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities as the night progresses. Marie feels hurt by Malcolm’s failure to see her value as a partner and individual with aspirations and creative potential. Critics were divided on the picture, but many lauded Zendaya and Washington for their work in the film. The 26th Annual Critics’ Choice Awards nominated Zendaya for Best Actress for her performance.</p><h2 id=h-6-spider-man-far-from-home-2019 data-injectable=false>6.&nbsp;Spider-Man: Far From Home&nbsp;(2019)</h2><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>Zendaya’s character, Michelle “MJ” Jones, returns in&nbsp;Spider-Man: Far From Home&nbsp;after making her debut in&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). The film adds variability to her personality and develops her romantic bond with Tom Holland’s Peter Parker/Spider-Man. With the development of her friendship with Peter Parker, however,&nbsp;Far From Home&nbsp;reveals a softer side of MJ to viewers. She expresses genuine worry and cares for Peter despite her usual austere demeanor.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=537 data-injectable=true>Zendaya’s portrayal of MJ stands out partly because she is so different from previous portrayals of the character in past&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;films. Zendaya’s MJ is less of a stereotypical “girl next door” and more of an eccentric, one-of-a-kind individual. Reviewers were generally enthusiastic about&nbsp;Spider-Man: Far From Home, praising the film’s wit, action, and graphics. As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the first&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;picture to earn over $1 billion</a>, it was the year’s fourth highest-grossing film.</p><h2 id=h-5-spider-man-homecoming-2017 data-injectable=false>5. Spider-Man: Homecoming&nbsp;(2017)</h2><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>Zendaya’s debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes in&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming, where she portrays Michelle Jones/MJ. MJ is a friend of Tom Holland’s Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man. Her portrayal is that of an intelligent, self-reliant, and intriguing character. MJ is reserved and prefers to watch events unfold from a distance. She has a sharp wit and often carries around a book, suggesting she is well-read.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>MJ’s uniqueness and forthrightness are well-known. Zendaya’s portrayal of MJ is a departure from the usual love interest or damsel in distress; instead, she is a confident young person with her own peculiarities and personality. In&nbsp;Homecoming, MJ and Peter Parker’s relationship is that of casual friends with hints of more. As the second most successful Spider-Man film, Homecoming was also the sixth highest-grossing film of 2017.</p><h2 id=h-4-the-greatest-showman-2017 data-injectable=false>4.&nbsp;The Greatest Showman&nbsp;(2017)</h2><p data-characters=551 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>In “The Greatest Showman” (2017), a musical drama inspired by the story of P.T. Barnum’s creation of Barnum’s American Museum, Zendaya plays Anne Wheeler, a trapeze artist. Anne Wheeler is a young African American woman who, along with her brother, joins Barnum’s circus troupe. She’s talented, graceful, and highly skilled at her craft, capturing audiences with her thrilling performances. However, as an African American in the 19th century, she faces racial discrimination and prejudice, which the film explores.</p><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>One of the main storylines in the movie is the romantic relationship between Anne and Phillip Carlyle, a playwright and Barnum’s business partner, played by Zac Efron. Their relationship, which crosses racial and social boundaries, is portrayed with sensitivity and becomes a focal point of the narrative. Zendaya showcases not only her acting skills but also her abilities as a singer and a dancer. Her duet with Zac Efron, “Rewrite the Stars,” is a standout musical number in the film.</p><h2 id=h-3-spider-man-no-way-home-2021 data-injectable=false>3.&nbsp;Spider-Man: No Way Home&nbsp;(2021)</h2><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>Zendaya returns as Peter Parker’s confidante and love interest in&nbsp;Spider-Man: No Way Home, continuing a character she originated in the previous films. Particularly with Peter, she displays compassion and empathy. She shows her understanding by checking in on Peter’s feelings when the world finds out he’s Spider-Man, and he doesn’t have to conceal or lie to anyone about it.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>Being in a wizard’s dungeon is a perfect example of her willingness to accept the supernatural elements they face, highlighting her adaptability. After earning over $1.9 billion worldwide,&nbsp;Spider-Man: No Way Home&nbsp;surpassed its predecessor as Sony Pictures’ highest-grossing film. It broke multiple box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of 2021 and the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time. It also became the highest-grossing&nbsp;Spider-Man&nbsp;film.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-2-dune-2021 data-injectable=false>2.&nbsp;Dune&nbsp;(2021)</h2><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Directed by Denis Villeneuve and adapted from Frank Herbert’s novel of the same name,&nbsp;Dune&nbsp;is an epic science fiction film in which Zendaya portrays the role of Chani. In&nbsp;Dune, the planet Arrakis is home to the Fremen, including our protagonist Chani. The blue eyes of the Fremen are a byproduct of their diet of the spice melange, the rarest and most valuable commodity in the known universe.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=553 data-current-count=553 data-injectable=true>Chani is a mighty and skilled warrior who feels a profound connection to her home planet despite its harsh conditions. She plays the love interest of Timothée Chalamet’s protagonist, Paul Atreides. Paul sees Chani in his dreams before they meet, indicating her pivotal role in his future.&nbsp;Dune&nbsp;garnered many awards and recognitions, including ten nominations at the 94th Academy prizes, six wins (including Best Actor in a Leading Role), and many others — one of the most influential science fiction stories of the 2020s and the 21st century.</p><h2 id=h-1-euphoria-2019-present data-injectable=false>1.&nbsp;Euphoria&nbsp;(2019 – Present)</h2><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>In&nbsp;Euphoria&nbsp;(on HBO), Zendaya plays Rue Bennet, a far more serious and grown-up character than her Disney Channel days roles. High school senior Rue Bennett faces the tricky waters of adolescence while battling drug addiction. The show doesn’t pull any punches when depicting Rue’s problems; it goes in-depth with her addiction, mental health concerns, and rocky relationships.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=918 data-injectable=false>Jules Vaughn, a transgender girl who moves to town and rapidly becomes Rue’s close friend and love interest, is one of the most important people in Rue’s life. Their connection has a significant role in shaping Rue’s personality throughout the series. The emotional depth and sincerity of Zendaya’s performance in&nbsp;Euphoria&nbsp;has won her widespread acclaim. She made history as the youngest recipient of the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her performance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Svpr%2FTZrGeppSWxqJ5zKitop2jYq6vsIytrWarmKTEtHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-zendaya-movies-and-tv-shows.html&text=The%2010%20best%20Zendaya%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-zendaya-movies-and-tv-shows.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-zendaya-movies-and-tv-shows.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Zendaya%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-zendaya-movies-and-tv-shows.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Zendaya%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-zendaya-movies-and-tv-shows.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Zendaya%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-zendaya-movies-and-tv-shows.html&description=The%2010%20best%20Zendaya%20movies%20and%20TV%20shows" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./travis-clark-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-58749-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Travis Clark Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./possession-movie-review-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Possession movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2021)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
