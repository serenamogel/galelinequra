One of his brothers took him to a juvenile football club to begin training for a possible career, but he often had to jog to the training grounds because his family couldn’t afford the transportation.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Atsu’s mother swept roads and sold smoked fish on the side of the road to feed her children, according to The Athletic. The family was eventually forced to live in an uncompleted building, with Atsu sleeping on a mattress in a bathroom.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While Atsu was away from home playing soccer, his father died from illness. The family couldn’t afford medical fees, so he was never treated.
