Surface stains can develop after prolonged exposure to highly pigmented drinks such as red wine and dark coffee.<h2>Do veneers stain with coffee?</h2>Dental veneers are highly effective at enhancing a person's natural smile and do not stain as quickly as your natural tooth enamel.

The underlying teeth may darken but not enough to make these veneers match your lower teeth.</p><h2>Can you use whitening toothpaste on veneers?</h2>However, whitening toothpastes can actually do more harm than good to porcelain veneers. Whitening toothpastes tend to have chemicals and other ingredients that are abrasive. Abrasive ingredients scratch the surface of porcelain veneers and make them lose their sheen.<h2>Can I use whitening strips on veneers?</h2>Do not use at-home bleaching kits, gels, or whitening strips, since they will not have any effect on perceived stains on porcelain veneers — but they may damage the porcelain. If your veneers are more than 15 to 20 years old, it may be time to replace them.<h2>What happens to veneers after 20 years?</h2>The average lifespan of a dental veneer is about 10 years.
