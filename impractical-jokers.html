Fans are specifically interested in Sal as not much is known about his personal life. There are no significant records of his dating life, which made people think he might be gay.</p><p>Back in 2014, Sal Vulcano left thousands of his fans shocked by admitting to being gay. However, Murray also confessed to being gay in the same interview which aired on national television.</p><p>Sal then revealed a centered tactic to help Murray come out and declare his orientation and sexual preferences. However, this was simply a staged thing. To this day, Sal’s sexual orientation and love life remain a mystery.</p><p>Joe is the only impractical joker who is married. Brian has a long history of complicated relationships that have become running gags on the show. Murray, on the other hand, is engaged yet to get married.</p><h2><strong>Are Impractical Jokers Staged?</strong></h2><p>One of the biggest questions about the hit TV show is if it is fake or real. The show is undeniably funny and has a top rating, making fans wonder if it is staged. According to the comedians, every prank is 100% real.</p><p>The show works because they are natural reactions to strangers who do not know they are on camera. While the pranks remain authentic, <a href=#>producers sometimes intervene</a> if an eager fan poses a threat to the scene.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges to ensuring that everything is authentic is that people recognize them due to their fame. They perform in New York, a city with over 8 million people. Therefore, the jokers shuffle them along, reset, and find someone else when someone recognizes them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7rEsKquqJSWwaa%2FjZympmeZor2zrcKtoJyZnGK3sLfEq6po</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fimpractical-jokers.html&text=Impractical%20Jokers%3a%20Net%20worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Ages%2c%20Gay&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fimpractical-jokers.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fimpractical-jokers.html&title=Impractical%20Jokers%3a%20Net%20worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Ages%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fimpractical-jokers.html&title=Impractical%20Jokers%3a%20Net%20worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Ages%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fimpractical-jokers.html&title=Impractical%20Jokers%3a%20Net%20worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Ages%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fimpractical-jokers.html&description=Impractical%20Jokers%3a%20Net%20worth%2c%20Salary%2c%20Ages%2c%20Gay" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./paul-costabile.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Paul Costabile?
