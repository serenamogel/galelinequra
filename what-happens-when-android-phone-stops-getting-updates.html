As you have read above, your phone will likely work fine on the older version of Android, and the developers will maintain support for it. And remember, a lot of phones might get updated, but it can take a while.<h2>Can a smartphone last 10 years?</h2>Although iOS and Android OS updates technically support devices for four or more years, certain apps – and OS updates themselves – can prove too power-hungry for previous years' specs. “Hardware could operate for five to ten years,” says Clapp.<h2>How do I get the latest version of Android on my old phone?</h2><p>You can also simply run a beefed up version of your existing OS, but do make sure that you choose the right ROMs.</p><li>Step 1 - Unlock the Bootloader. ...</li><li>Step 2 - Run a Custom Recovery. ...</li><li>Step 3 - Backup the existing Operating system. ...</li><li>Step 4 - Flash the Custom ROM. ...</li><li>Step 5 - Flashing GApps (Google apps)</li><h2>What happens when a device is no longer supported?</h2>If you continue to use an unsupported version of Windows, your PC will still work, but it will become more vulnerable to security risks and viruses.
