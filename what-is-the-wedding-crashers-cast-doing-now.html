The story follows two friends, John and Jeremy, who spend the popular wedding season crashing ceremonies to meet women. The film was praised for its fun plot and hilarious cast, and was also a huge commercial success, with over 288 million dollars earned at the box office against a budget of 40 million.&nbsp;There have been talks of a sequel — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wedding Crashers 2</a> – for years now, but nothing concrete so far.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>While the film’s leads, Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, were already well known in Hollywood, many members of the cast were catapulted to great fame after the film’s success and have become household names.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>Here’s what the cast of Wedding Crashers are up to now, and the exciting projects some of them have lined up for the future.</p><h3 id=h-owen-wilson data-injectable=false>Owen Wilson</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/8666741F-B248-4DC8-8398-713C8A46622A.jpeg><p data-characters=701 data-current-count=701 data-injectable=true>No stranger to the limelight before and after his hilarious turn as John Beckwith in Wedding Crashers, Owen Wilson is one of many A-list actors that made up the film’s cast. Wilson has been on screens since 1996’s Bottle Rocket and has been an in-demand actor for a long while. He recently starred in the romantic comedy Marry Me alongside Jennifer Lopez. His upcoming endeavors include: Loki’s second season, the superhero film Secret Headquarters to be released on Aug. 5 on Paramount Plus, and the horror comedy Haunted Mansion, set for an early 2023 release. As a voice actor, Wilson will continue his portrayal of Cars’ Lightning McQueen on the Disney Plus series, Cars on the Road.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Vince Vaughn</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/38F72ACA-7E30-4E99-86BC-057AC37569DE.jpeg><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=934 data-injectable=true>Another hilarious comedian, and the ying to Wilson’s yang in the comedy film, Vince Vaughn played the role of the less pragmatic Jeremy Grey who is roped into John’s plan to get closer to the Clearys. Vaughn’s Hollywood career kicked off&nbsp; in the late eighties and blossomed into a coveted career with numerous films under his belt. His 2020s are also off to a great start with five film roles since 2020, one of which is the role of the Blissfield Butcher in the slasher comedy, Freaky.

While her television catalogue is limited, McAdams has had a boisterous film career, most recently starring as Christine Palmer in the Marvel blockbuster, Doctor Strange and its darker sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. She will star in the upcoming comedy-drama Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret — set for an April 2023 release.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Bradley Cooper</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/F0D68D2B-9CC2-4992-B4E0-7D1B594A2792.jpeg><p data-characters=856 data-current-count=1156 data-injectable=true>Another one of many A-list actors that made up the ensemble cast of Wedding Crashers, Bradley Cooper has had a long and prosperous career since his stint as the aggressive bully Sack Lodge, the boyfriend to Rachel McAdams’ Claire.

The British-American actress starred as Kathleen, the matriarch of the Cleary family. Seymour has had a couple of interesting roles in the 2020s, starring as Addison Walker in The Guardians of Justice, and as conflicted Literature professor Harriet Wild in the Acorn TV original series, Harry Wild.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Keir O’Donnell</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/02FD9761-E0BD-40B3-84BE-48E245604789.jpeg><p data-characters=600 data-current-count=900 data-injectable=true>Keir O’Donnell’s breakthrough role was undoubtedly Wedding Crashers, as the Australian-American actor featured solely in independent films. Following his portrayal of the socially awkward Todd Cleary, Vince Vaughn enlisted O’Donnell to follow him on his Wild West Comedy Tour. His other major films include Paul Blart: Mall Cop and When in Rome. Even though his television and film roles have greatly reduced so far in the new decade, O’Donnell landed a supporting role in the 2022 action thriller, Ambulance, starring alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Eiza González.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Will Ferrell</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/EEC29528-0BF0-476F-AC6A-104B25168885.jpeg><p data-characters=562 data-current-count=862 data-injectable=false>While the lovable comedian had a very brief cameo in the film, he was still very recognizable, what with being one of the most popular actors on the planet. Will Ferrell starred as Chazz Reinhold, the wedding crashing mentor of Vaughn’s character Jeremy. Ferrell is one of Hollywood’s most prolific comedians, having starred in a plethora of comedies. His upcoming films include Spirited, a modern retelling of A Christmas Carol; the live-action animated film Strays; and the much anticipated live-adaptation, Barbie, where he will portray the CEO of Mattel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaSdsm7DxJ2boqaXYrCzrdKhnKurXZiutMCMnaaippdiu7DDjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-the-wedding-crashers-cast-doing-now.html&text=What%20is%20the%20Wedding%20Crashers%20cast%20doing%20now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-the-wedding-crashers-cast-doing-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-wedding-crashers-cast-doing-now.html&title=What%20is%20the%20Wedding%20Crashers%20cast%20doing%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-the-wedding-crashers-cast-doing-now.html&title=What%20is%20the%20Wedding%20Crashers%20cast%20doing%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-wedding-crashers-cast-doing-now.html&title=What%20is%20the%20Wedding%20Crashers%20cast%20doing%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-the-wedding-crashers-cast-doing-now.html&description=What%20is%20the%20Wedding%20Crashers%20cast%20doing%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./196985-former-wwe-diva-teasing-a-wrestlemania-appearance.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Former WWE Diva Teasing A Wrestlemania Appearance">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./peter-lewiss-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Peter Lewiss biography, fact, career, awards, net worth &amp;amp; life story">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
