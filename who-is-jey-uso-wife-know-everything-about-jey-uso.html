High-energy and acrobatic, Jey’s ring style combines strong strikes with darting movements.</p><p>Joshua Samuel Fatu, better known as Jey Uso, was born in San Francisco, California, on August 22, 1985. He comes from the illustrious Anoa’i family, which also includes his uncle Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, a great wrestler. Their father, former WWE wrestler Rikishi, taught Jey and his twin brother Jimmy how to wrestle.</p><p>37 years of age is Jey Uso. Throughout his career in wrestling, Jey has accomplished a lot, becoming one of the most well-liked and well-respected wrestlers in the business and winning numerous championships.

With his weight of about 227 lbs (103 kg), he has the strength and ability to carry out his signature maneuvers, like the Samoan Drop and the Superkick.</p><p>Jey Uso is an American citizen because he was born and reared in San Francisco, California. His cultural links to Samoa and Tonga, though, are a significant part of who he is and have shaped his wrestling style.</p><p>Jey is proud of his Polynesian roots and frequently infuses aspects of that culture into his persona, such as by dancing the Haka before games. Despite being an American citizen, Jey’s affinity for his family and culture transcends national boundaries and connects with admirers all across the world.</p><h2>The career of Jey Uso</h2><p>In 2007, Jey Uso made his professional wrestling debut. In 2009, he started competing for WWE’s developmental organization Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW).
